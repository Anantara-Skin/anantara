					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong translate="no">SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Poremizing Clear Toner 210ml</strong> is an exfoliating toner that helps to decrease the visibility of enlarged pores, while helping to gently renew the skin's texture. The formula boasts a complex of 4 types of exfoliating acids. These acids work to remove dead skin cells, also helping to unclog pores. The result is a skin surface that is not only smoother and softer but also purified. Moreover, Himalayan pink salt boasts a high mineral content, with over 80 different minerals. The salinity creates an osmotic pressure that aids in drawing out impurities from the pores, ensuring a thorough cleanse. The Sebum Cleaner helps to control excess sebum, ensuring that the skin remains balanced. Last but not least, the inclusion of Madagascar <i>Centella asiatica</i> extract ensures that the skin remains soothed and protected during the exfoliation process. In essence, this toner helps to unclog and reduce the visibility of pores, while delivering a smooth and refined skin texture.</p>
