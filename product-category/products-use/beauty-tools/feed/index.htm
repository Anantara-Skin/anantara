										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With its different angle points and textures, this gua shan is created to give you maximum effect. Use the pointed zone to boost blood flow to the scalp &#8211; hey, who doesn&#8217;t want shinier and healthier hair?</p>
<p>The heart zone will become your best friend in the quest for a slimmer face. Just drag the tool along your jawline and voilà &#8211; your natural contours are more visible than ever!</p>
<p>Do you want to soften your cheekbones and give your skin some extra elasticity? Then the round zone is for you. And the curve zone is perfect for relieving neck tension &#8211; like a little spa treatment in your living room.</p>
<p>The bump area gives you a soothing massage of the temples, and the acupressure zone is designed for lymphatic drainage massage, which helps reduce swelling and clears toxins from the skin.</p>

Increased skin elasticity: The round zone helps stimulate cell renewal and promotes skin elasticity. It&#8217;s like a little gym for your skin &#8211; but without the sweat!<br />
Relieves muscle tension: Thanks to the curve zone, you can say goodbye to neck and jaw tension. A few minutes with this feature every day can give you that great feeling of relaxation.<br />
Reduces swelling: The acupressure zone is perfect for lymphatic drainage massage. It may sound advanced, but it&#8217;s all about clearing out toxins and reducing facial swelling.<br />
